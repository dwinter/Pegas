##Pegas 0.4

This is **not** the official source code for Pegas - for that see the [CRAN Repository](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pegas/index.html). 

This branch of this repository has a couple of extra functions I've found useful.

* `h.div`               calculates haplotype diversity for a sample
* `MMD.stable`          gives an expected mismatch distribution for a stable population size
* `diversity.indices`   gives diversity indices (h,n,pi...) for an alignment
* `compare.diversity`   gives similar statistics across a set of populations

There is also a function `tajima.sim.test` to use a simulate distribution of test the signficance of Tajimas _D_ but that's a work in progress...
